- **Qubit**: A bit that can exist in a *superposition state*
- **Superposition state**: The superposition state contains the probabilities of the bit being 1 or 0, but since its neither one, it can be represented as a vector. 
Ex.) $|ψ⟩ = α|0⟩ + β|1⟩$

- **Why is it a sphere?**: It is a sphere because the vectors can point anywhere on the sphere and the norm is always 1. 
- **Norm-perserving (unitary)**: gates that perserve the complex norm as equal to 1
- **Magnitude of complex number**: The magnitude of a complex number $a + bi$ is given by $|a + bi| = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$.
- **Global phase:** Imagine spinning the ball representing a qubit's states around. The global phase is like spinning the entire ball. It doesn't change the chances of each state, just like how spinning the ball doesn't change where the points are on its surface. It is represented as $a * e^{i * \phi}$,
