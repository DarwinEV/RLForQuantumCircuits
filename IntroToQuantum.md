- **Qubit**: A bit that can exist in a *superposition state*
- **Superposition state**: The superposition state contains complex probability amplitudes α and β, representing the probabilities of the qubit being in state 0 or 1.
Ex.) $|ψ⟩ = α|0⟩ + β|1⟩$

- **Why is it a sphere?**: Qubit states are represented as points on the surface of a sphere. This spherical representation demonstrates the normalization condition of quantum states, meaning that the sum of probabilities for any state is always 1.
- **Quantum Circuits**: Computational models compromised by a sequence of gates that manipulate input qubits. The result are output qubits similar to classical circuits that manipulate bits with classical logic gates.
- **Quantum Gates**: Operations used to manipulate qubits in quantum circuits. These operations are reversible unlike some classical gates.
- **Norm-perserving (unitary)**: Gates that perserve the complex norm as equal to 1
- **Magnitude of complex number**: The magnitude of a complex number $a + bi$ is given by $|a + bi| = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$.
- **Global phase:** Imagine spinning the ball representing a qubit's states around. The global phase is like spinning the entire ball. It doesn't change the chances of each state, just like how spinning the ball doesn't change where the points are on its surface. It is represented as $a * e^{i * \phi}$,
